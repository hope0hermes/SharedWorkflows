# SharedWorkflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows and composite actions for Python projects. Provides a complete CI/CD pipeline with testing, linting, automated releases, and more.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Python Projects Using Hatch

Replace your existing workflows with these simple calls:

**`.github/workflows/tests.yml`**
```yaml
name: Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    uses: hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows/.github/workflows/reusable-tests.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: "3.12"
      package-name: "my_package"
      coverage-threshold: 80
    secrets:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**`.github/workflows/commitlint.yml`**
```yaml
name: Lint Commit Messages

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  commitlint:
    uses: hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows/.github/workflows/reusable-commitlint.yml@main
```

**`.github/workflows/release.yml`**
```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  release:
    uses: hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows/.github/workflows/reusable-release.yml@main
    with:
      package-path: "src/my_package/__init__.py"
    secrets:
      PAT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
```

**`.github/workflows/create-release.yml`**
```yaml
name: Create Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  create-release:
    uses: hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows/.github/workflows/reusable-create-release.yml@main
    secrets:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Result**: Complete CI/CD automation in ~40 lines total! üéâ

## üì¶ What's Included

### Reusable Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Lines Saved |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `reusable-tests.yml` | Run linting and tests with coverage | ~60 lines |
| `reusable-commitlint.yml` | Validate conventional commits | ~80 lines |
| `reusable-release.yml` | Automated version bumping | ~150 lines |
| `reusable-create-release.yml` | Create GitHub releases | ~70 lines |

### Composite Actions

**Testing Actions:**
- `python-lint` - Ruff, mypy, pylint, pydocstyle
- `python-test` - Pytest with coverage
- `python-ci` - Combined linting + testing

**Release Actions:**
- `check-skip-conditions` - Skip logic for version bumps
- `determine-version-bump` - Semantic version analysis
- `bump-version` - Version bumping with hatch
- `update-changelog` - CHANGELOG.md updates
- `create-version-pr` - PR creation for version bumps
- `extract-version` - Extract version from commits
- `create-github-release` - GitHub release creation

## üí° Examples

### Use Individual Actions

```yaml
jobs:
  custom-ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Custom pre-check
      - name: Verify dependencies
        run: ./scripts/check-deps.sh
      
      # Reusable linting action
      - name: Lint code
        uses: hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows/actions/python-lint@main
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
      
      # Custom validation
      - name: Validate schemas
        run: python scripts/validate.py
      
      # Reusable testing action
      - name: Run tests
        uses: hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows/actions/python-test@main
        with:
          coverage-threshold: 90
```

### Parallel Testing

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    uses: hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows/actions/python-lint@main
  
  test:
    uses: hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows/actions/python-test@main
```

### Matrix Testing

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows/actions/python-test@main
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
```
